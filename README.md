<h2>Description:</h2>
I developed the application in two parts, a client applet which interacts with a server application via TCP. The features of the client applet include live ranking, chat discussion, news items, company stocks and their market values, the status of share market and sensex. The features of the admin application (server) include live view of the users, their details, stocks and money, set news items, set time limit, block chat, delete user, view rankings, chat discussion and edit stock prices.
